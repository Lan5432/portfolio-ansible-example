# Summary

The setup is a series of commands to raise locally ran docker containers that each run a role, and then connecting to them via SSH.

Long story short, I didn't want to setup an infrastructure of machines in AWS as I was sure a local setup could be done, and also felt easier than to look into use-based payment plans for instances. Since my time learning this stuff is spent rather esporadically.
Obviously it wouldn't hurt to learn cloud management, but step by step.


## Commands
Some commands I've played with to debug my setup, I found myself forgetting them from time to time so why not writing them here:
- Test that the containers can be accessed: `ssh test@localhost -p 2022`
